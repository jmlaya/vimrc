<a id="about-vimrc" class="anchor" href="#about-vimrc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About vimrc</h2>

<p>vimrc is the main configuration file for the text editor Vim. This file contains instructions that are executed by Vim on start up. Usually people write here settings that they want to enable whenever Vim gets started so that the settings that they like are enabled <em>by default</em> as the program executes.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Backup</strong>. By keeping a copy of my Vim configuration online, if I ever accidentally damage my settings I can always restore them. If I have to format my computer, change operating system or install a new computer or virtual machine I can easily get my configuration in a breeze.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sync</strong>. I have a copy on Vim on most of the computers I have to regulary touch. This includes my own computer, some servers, virtual machines and even my work computer, using Vim for Windows. If I modify my Vim configuration I can push it here and them pull it from any other machine that I use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sharing</strong>: anyone can look at my dotfiles and get inspiration or cool ideas, then add those settings to their own dotfiles. It's a great way to learn something new.</p></li>
</ol>

<a id="using-this-vimrc" class="anchor" href="#using-this-vimrc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using this vimrc</h2>

<p>Anyone is free to use my vimrc. But keep in mind that this configuration is mine and designed to fit in my workflow. Not everybody works the same and if you want to use this vimrc you probably want to modify your configuration file before.</p>

<p>I encourage you to fork this repository. Then, clone your own fork, then make your own tweaks, and then push them to your own repository (it's yours, you can anyway!). Now you have your settings online too, which is cool because of all the reasons I said before.</p>

<p>Let me repeat one more time about my workflow. This configuration file may make use of plugins to extend what Vim can and cannot do. This might include plugins to work with compilers or other software that you may not even use. So, keep in mind that using this configuration in a wild computer might not be optimal without any tweaks.</p>

<a id="disclaimer" class="anchor" href="#disclaimer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>These settings work for me on my machines. I definitely am no responsible if using these settings makes your computer burn, your microwave explode or something like that. Just leave me alone.</p>
